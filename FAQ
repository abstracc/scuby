Q: Which style of Ruby embedding does Scuby use?
A: At the moment it uses the RedBridge JSR223 support

Q: Which local variable, threading and JRuby instance modes are supported?
A: Scuby makes no assumptions as to the local variable, threading and JRuby
   instance modes. If your application needs to set a specific mode, set the
   appropriate system property as documented in the JRuby Embed Wiki page,
   before the first call to Scuby.

Q: Does Scuby use implicit symbol to function conversions, so that Ruby methods
   can be represented as Scala symbols?
A: Not yet but it's something to explore in the future.

Q: Is it possible to pass a top-level method to a Scala function that takes a
   function (i.e., .map)?
A: Not yet. This is part of the "block/FunctionN integration" task mentioned in
   the README.

Q: With Scuby I can save a method that is called on an object for "later", i.e.
   val method = backEnd --> 'get_additional_data
   Is it possible to do the same thing with a top level method at this time?
A: Not yet.
