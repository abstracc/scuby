Scuby is a thin integration layer between Scala and JRuby. It aims to provide
DSLs for Scala and JRuby to ease interoperability. The original inspiration came
from a couple of articles published by Daniel Spiewak at his blog,
http://www.codecommit.com. These are the two articles:

JRuby Interop DSL in Scala (http://www.codecommit.com/blog/ruby/jruby-interop-dsl-in-scala)
Integrating Scala into JRuby (http://www.codecommit.com/blog/ruby/integrating-scala-into-jruby)

The idea behind this polyglot architecture came about based on a post by Ola Bini
called "Fractal Programming" (http://olabini.com/blog/2008/06/fractal-programming/)
in which he talks about dividing a program in 3 layers: the static layer for
performance-critical functionality and those functions in which type safety is
paramount, a dynamic layer where you create a DSL, and a DSL layer where the
bulk of the business logic resides.

Scuby was first publicly presented at the 2009 RubyConf, in the talk "Ruby is
from Mars, Functional Languages are from Venus: Integrating Ruby with Erlang,
Scala or F#" by Angela O.K. Wright.

The project is sponsored by Abstra.cc (http://www.abstra.cc) where we use it for
our internal development.

ADDING SCUBY TO YOUR PROJECT:

To add Scuby to a Maven project, just add the following dependency:
<dependency>
  <groupId>cc.abstra.pasilla</groupId>
  <artifactId>scuby</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.8</version>
</dependency>

If you use SBT, please convert this to SBT syntax.

DEPENDENCIES:

The Scuby pom.xml file includes dependencies on org.scala-lang.scala-library 2.9.2
and org.jruby.jruby 1.6.7. If you don't use Maven or something that understands
Maven pom.xml files, you will need to download the corresponding jars and
place them in your CLASSPATH.

At the moment Scuby is based on JRuby 1.6.7 and Scala 2.9.2, even though it
makes almost no use (yet) of the new Java interoperability features of JRuby
1.4+. These should slowly find their way into Scuby as time permits.

USAGE:

At this point the Scala -> Ruby part is partly done, while the Ruby -> Scala
part is still in the planning stages (although with the JRuby changes in 1.6.x.
it's become less necessary). Let's start with some of the things you can do today.
Here are some examples. Assume you have the following Ruby code in a file called
test.rb which is somewhere in your CLASSPATH (this file is part of the unit tests
and can be found in src/test/resources/test.rb):

module Core
  class Person
    attr_accessor :firstname, :lastname
    def initialize (firstname, lastname)
      @firstname = firstname
      @lastname = lastname
   end

    def fullname
      "#{firstname} #{lastname}"
    end

    def get_label
      javax.swing.JLabel.new(fullname)
    end
  end

  module BackEnd
   def self.get_people
      # Get data from the backend and return an Array of Person
    end

    def self.get_data
      { :people => get_people, :other_data => get_other_data }
    end

    def self.get_person(name)
      # Get a person's data from the backend and return a Person object
    end

    def self.get_other_data
      # Get some other data that is needed for the app
    end
  end
end


Here are some examples using Scuby:

import cc.abstra.scuby._
import JRuby._

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = { 
    // Require a Ruby file from the classpath
    require("example") 

    // Eval a Ruby statement discarding the return value
    eval("import Core") 

    // Eval a Ruby statement that returns a Ruby object
    val array = eval[RubyObj]("[]")

    // Or with type inference
    val array2:RubyObj = eval("[]")

    // Create a Ruby object
    val array3 = new RubyObject('Array)

    // Easily call is_a? and respond_to?
    array3 isA_? 'Array // true
    array3 isA_? 'Hash  // false

    array3 respondTo_? 'length // true
    array3 respondTo_? 'foo    //false

    // Create a proxy object for the Ruby BackEnd class
    val backEnd = RubyClass('BackEnd)

    // Create an instance of the Person class
    val person = new RubyObject('Person, "Zaphod", "Beeblebrox")
    val person2 = RubyClass('Person) ! ('new, "Ford", "Prefect")

    // Call a method on a Ruby object (in this case, the Ruby class),
    // passing in parameters, and get back another Ruby object
    val zaphod = backEnd ! ('get_person, "Zaphod")

    // Call a Ruby method with no parameters
    val data = backEnd ! 'get_data

    // Ruby method chaining
    val length = backEnd ! 'get_people ! 'length

    // Access to a Ruby hash or array (i.e., something that implements the
    // [] method]). Returns an AnyRef (i.e. a java.lang.Object). Also, creating
    // a Ruby Symbol using %
    val people = data(%('people))
    val zaphod2 = people(0)

    // Multidimensional hashes or arrays (i.e., data["parm1"]["parm2"])
    val ford = data(%('people), 1)

    // Modify/add an element to a Collection (or anything that implements []=)
    people(2) = RubyClass('Person) ! ('new, "Arthur", "Dent")

    // Get a reference to a Ruby method that can later be called
    val getPerson = backEnd --> 'get_person

    // Call the method. Returns an AnyRef. With the above, these 2 lines are
    // equivalent:
    getPerson("Zaphod") 
    backEnd('get_person, "Zaphod")

    // Call a Ruby method which returns a Java object, in a type-safe way
    val label = person.send[JLabel]('get_label)

    // This is one way of chaining method calls that include array access. This
    // is kind of ugly but necessary because of the strong typing, since
    // Array/Hash access returns an AnyRef.
    // Ruby equivalent:
    // label = backEnd.get_people[:people][0].get_label
    // contents = form.components[:startables].widget.peer  # Returns a JComponent
    val label = (backEnd ! 'get_data ! ('[], %('people)) ! ('[], 0)).send[JLabel]('get_label)
    // OR
    val zaphod3 = (backEnd ! 'get_data(%'people, 0)).asInstanceOf[RubyObj]
    val label = zaphod3.get_label

    // You can also use the as[T] method to wrap a RubyObj with a
    // dynamically-generated proxy for a trait, to get all the statically-typed
    // goodness on the Scala side. The proxy also takes care of the CamelCase to
    // snake_case conversion. I have tested the basic calls and case conversion,
    // plus the attribute assignments. More testing is needed to make sure
    // there are no more edge cases
    trait Person {
      def firstname: String
      def firstname_=(f: String): Unit
      def lastname: String
      def lastname_=(l: String): Unit
      def fullname: String
      def getLabel: JLabel
    }

    val zaphod:Person = new RubyObject('Person, "Zaphod", "Beeblebrox").as[Person]
    zaphod.firstname = "The Zeeb"
    println(zaphod.fullname)
    val label = zaphod.getLabel
 }
}

This is the gist of it. Basically we can create Ruby objects, call methods on them
and evaluate Ruby code. Scuby has its own RubyObj class that wraps a RubyObject and
does its magic. It also has its own RubyClass class that represents a Ruby class.


NEXT STEPS (for 1.0)

Calling JRuby from Scala:

* Transparently wrap Ruby collections in Scala collections, so you can use them
  with foreach, for, map, foldLeft, foldRight, etc...

* Create traits that mimic the standard Ruby object hierarchy, at least for Object,
  Class and Module, and either allow the traits passed in to as[T] to wrap them,
  or automatically extend the traits depending on the Ruby object's type

* More test cases for as[T] and perhaps simplify the implementation

* More testing in general

Calling Scala from JRuby (although lots of it is handled automatically by JRuby)

* Block/FunctionN conversion, so you could pass in a Scala function to any Ruby
  method that expects a block.

* Wrapping the Scala collections with their Ruby equivalents.

* Add an Object#to_scala method which wraps the Ruby Object in a Scuby RubyObj.
  Ideally the wrapping should be done automatically but I'm not totally sure if
  that's possible.
